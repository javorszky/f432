Compass-less WordPress starter theme based on Foundation 4.3.2

# Prerequisites
You will need to run `gem install sass --pre` in order to get the sourcemaps working. Otherwise you need `grunt` (see the Grunt.js website), and that's it. This is made out of the scss standalone version of Zurb's Foundation 4.3.2. Good thing is, if you really want to, you can also just slap `bourbon` on top of it. (http://bourbon.io/) Don't though, there's no point to it, as Foundation has semantic grid built into it. :)

## Tools

Grunt is included. With that come the amazing abilities of jshint!

Also, it's best if you have the following sublime packages installed:
* [sidebargit](https://github.com/SublimeText/SideBarGit)
* [sublime jshint](https://github.com/uipoet/sublime-jshint)
* [sublime-jshint gutter](https://github.com/victorporof/Sublime-JSHint)
* [gitgutter](https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter)
* [sublime grunt](https://github.com/tvooo/sublime-grunt)
